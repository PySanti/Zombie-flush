Recomendations: 
        
        1- Press f11 to activate full screen, the game was made considering that
        2- Flush as much zombies as you can !

Considerations:

        1- There can not be more than 5 zombies alive, otherwise you lose
        2- You'll have a limited bullets count, don't fail the shoot!
        3- Vampires have a value of 5 times a zombie
        4- Bullets packeges apear sometimes, don't waste them
        5- If you spend all of your bullets, you'll have to punch them
